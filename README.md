# Tableau Embedding Playbook

Embedding Tableau content allows you to add the power of interactive visualization to external applications. Common use cases of embedding are:
* Tableau dashboards as components of line-of-business or vertical applications
* Embedding into internal knowledge bases and CRM systems
* Adding interactive visualization to blog posts

The act of embedding a single dashboard or visualization into a single webpage is quite simple, but a well-engineered integration includes other subjects such as authentication, authorization, content management, and performance. Depending on your integration goals, you may require the use of a variety of features and techniques.

This guide will introduce you to those features and techniques and provide you with additional resources to get up and running.
